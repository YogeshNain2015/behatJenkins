Sample Behat Test Suite
=======================

This sample behat test suite is designed for testing a simple integration between Behat, Sahi, PhantomJS and JenkinsCI.

The build process depends on Phing, which is assumed to be installed and is not included in composer.json.

Installation of Sahi and PhantomJS is not covered.
